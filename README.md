# CIFAR10
Image Recognition on CIFAR10 dataset using CNN model architecture

## Objective:
To develop a Convolutional Neural Network that reaches state-of-the-art predictions on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Next Steps:
- Split Training into a validation set
- Visualize Loss and accuracy on Training vs Validation
- Get baseline prediction (model.evaluate)
- Create training visualizations (Confusion Matrix, Learning Rate Search, Train Vs Validation, Accuracy)
- Perform a learning rate search (increase learning rate exponentially with each batch, plot against loss -- see where loss exploodes)
